# Welcome to the Developers Collective!
## About Us
We are a group of programmers from around the world. We enjoy programming tools for various hobby projects and sharing them with the community. Right now our focus lies on modding New Super Mario Bros. Wii. Long term we plan to collect all kinds of repositories here however, based on what we end up working on after ending our modding journey. If you are interested in joining us, feel free to contact us!
